          <p class="card-text">Mohammed Arafat is a 27 year old Palestinian writer and poet from Gaza. He has been a witness to three violent wars on the strip, where he lost friends and neighbors. Directly after the 2014 war on Gaza, he published <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Still-Living-There-Mohammad-Arafat/dp/1503274020">Still Living There</a>, a novel which talks about a Palestinian farmer forced to leave Haifa to Gaza during the 1948 Nakbah, and the resultant suffering of Palestinian refugees.</p>

            <p>Mohammed lived in Chile for a year, during which he started a project to reconnect Palestinians of Chile, which has the biggest Palestinian community outside Palestine, to their native culture through poetry.</p>
            
            <p>Being an intern at the Capitol Hill, Mohammed is at work on his second book, which uses poetry to talk about his life back home and the Gazan humanitarian crises.</p>
            
            <p>Through his work, Mohammed aims to make the unheard voices heard.</p>
